# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mk!

🎯 I'm a 15 y/o tech enthusiast and hobbyist who builds cool stuff with ESP32, Arduino, Python, and AI.

💡 I turn ideas into real working robots, smart systems, and IoT gadgets.  
🔧 Most of my builds combine microcontrollers, sensors, automation, and a little creativity.

## 🚀 What I Build
- 🔹 **ESP32 WiFi Rover** — Web-controlled robot car with L298N, tb6612fng
- 🔹 **ESP32-CAM Security Bot** — Streams live video with object detection (YOLOv8) along with wifi controlled motion and automatic motion(vl53l0x based)
- 🔹 **MPU6050 Cube Viewer** — Tracks orientation in real time(integrated in esp32 cam security bot)
-   **esp32 based bluetooth gamepad** for phones using joystick module
- 🔹 More coming soon...

## 🛠️ Tools I Use
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO / MicroPython
- Git & GitHub
- Python + OpenCV + YOLO
- Sensors: MPU6050, HC-SR04, RFID, Camera Modules, vl53l0x, 

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- YOLOv8 integration with ESP32-CAM
- Creating full portfolio with GitHub Pages
- Advanced automation with vl53l0x + motors
- analog electronics and use of basic ICs and analog components like transistors, thermistors

> 🚧 This profile is a work in progress — like me. I build, break, and learn.
## IMP: 
i am still very poor at coding, so i use ai tools and open source codes for it, i learn by myself rather than online courses
